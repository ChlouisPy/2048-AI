# 2048-AI
An AI that learns to play 2048 with deep reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm

## Result :
the results of the genetic algorithm and reinforce 
learning are very bad, the models rarely reach a 256.
There is a problem with using reinforce learning and
genetic algorithms: the random exploration actions 
can cause the learning to go wrong. Another problem 
is that there are too many strategies, so the genetic 
algorithms can't agree. 

## Use model :
Does not use deep learning just brute force the game (and it doesn't work)
